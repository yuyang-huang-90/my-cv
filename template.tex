    and makes low level connection details agnostic to the application.}
  \item[--]{Design and implement an application level projecting solution for phone to vehicle projection.}
\end{itemize}

\cventry{February 2018--July 2020}{ Next-generation ultra-low latency
  trading platform.}{Electronic trading
platform development}{Java,C/C++,Slang,Python}{}{\textbf{Techniques:}  Performance
analysis, algorithm design and implementation and distributed system development}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[--]{Designed and implemented a next generation sequencer based ultra-low
    latency electrical trading platform, which provided less than 150us end to end latency for synthetic market access.}
  \item[--]{Provided L3 support for the platform.}
\end{itemize}
